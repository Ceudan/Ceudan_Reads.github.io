## About Me
I am a machine learning research intern at Huawei Technologies, and an engineering student at the University of Toronto.  

Through internships at various research labs I've gained exposure to SOTA technologies in domains such as Autonomous Robotics and Intelligent Transportation Systems. Currently I am performing research at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab Autonomous Driving Division. At the start of my internship I investigated methods for realistic behavioral modelling for simulations using imitation and reinforcement learning. These simulations are used to test the safety of AV planning algorithms. Currently I am researching trajectory prediction algorithms, which is used to predict how the scene will evolve while the vehicle is driving. Previously at the [Data Driven Decision Making Lab](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca) and [University of Toronto Transportation Research](https://uttri.utoronto.ca/), I became familiar with cutting-edge techniques in traffic signal control, and classical traffic modelling methods respectively. I have a strong mathematical foundation, having taken courses with honors in topics such as statistics, probability, and machine learning.


I've also enjoyed great extra-curricular experiences. In 2021 I rigorously trained in competitive programming. Later that year I qualified to join the University of Toronto's International Collegiate Programming Contest Team, with 2 teammates and myself finishing 15th/83 at the 2022 [East Central North America ICPC Regionals](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/East-Central-NA-2021/standings). I'm also a speaker at the University of Toronto Machine Intelligence Student Team, sharing my reinforcement learning knowledge to fellow students.


## Interests
My interests lie in the modelling, prediction, and planning of spatial-temporal systems at micro or macro scale. In the growing fields of Autonomous Driving, Robotics, and Intelligent Transportation Systems, these skills are needed in research and engineering roles to ensure safe and accurate end-products. Most importantly, I am also open to exploring new areas of Data Science.
